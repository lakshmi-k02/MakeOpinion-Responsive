             <p>
               The operator assumes no liability for the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the information provided on our website. Liability claims against the operator relating to material or immaterial damage caused by the use or non-use of the presented information or by the use of incorrect and incomplete information are generally excluded, provided that there is no demonstrable intentional or gross negligence on the operator's part.</p>
             <p>All offers are subject to change and non-binding. The operator reserves the right to change, supplement, delete, or temporarily or permanently discontinue parts of the pages or the entire offer without separate notice.</p>
             <p>References and links:
               In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites ("hyperlinks") that are outside the operator's area of responsibility, liability would only come into effect if the operator had knowledge of the content and it was technically possible and reasonable to prevent the use in the case of illegal content.</p>
             <p>The operator at this moment expressly declares that at the time of setting the link, no illegal content was recognizable on the pages to be linked. The operator does not influence the current and future design, content, or authorship of the linked/referenced pages. Therefore, the operator distances itself from all content of all linked/referenced pages changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all links and references placed within the operator's internet offering and to external entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists, and all other databases to which external write access is possible. The provider of the page to which reference was made is solely liable for illegal, incorrect, or incomplete content and, in particular, for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information presented, and not the one who merely refers to the respective publication via links.</p>
