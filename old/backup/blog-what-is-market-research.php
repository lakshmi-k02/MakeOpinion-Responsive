                       <p>Market research is the process of gathering, analysing and interpreting information about a market, about a product or service to be offered for sale in that market, and about the past, present and potential customers for the product or service; research into the characteristics, spending habits, location and needs of your business's target market, the industry as a whole, and the particular competitors you face.
                       The primary purpose of conducting market research is to understand or examine the market associated with a particular product or service to decide how the audience will react to a product or service. The information obtained from conducting market research can be used to tailor marketing/ advertising activities or determine consumersâ€™ feature priorities/service requirements (if any).</p>
                        
                       <h5>Why is Market Research important?</h5>
                       <p>Conducting research is one of the best ways of increasing customer satisfaction, expanding business. Market research is an important tool during all product development phases: from inception until sunsetting a product.</p>
                       <p>Here are the reasons why market research is important and should be considered in any business:</p>
                       <ol start="" role="list">
                       <li><b>Validate business ideas:</b> before investing into creating a new product you can understand if people have a level of interest for it</li>
                       <li><b>Customer segmentation:</b> helps you understand who your customers are, what they need and want so you can design products or services that best suit them.</li>
                       <li><b>Increase new product launches success:</b> find the product price attractive for your customers, product name, logo, slogans that your customers will love</li>
                       <li><b>Improve marketing campaigns:</b> by testing ads and messaging, designing the perfect product package for your online or offline products</li>
                       <li><b>Identify issues with your products and/or brand:</b> what do your customers think about your products? What is missing? Do they trust your brand?</li>
                       <li><b>Build a powerful brand:</b> understand how your brand is perceived by your customers, and strategise accordingly</li>
                       <li><b>Identify profitable markets:</b> to increase sales by understanding your competitor advantages and new opportunities in new market segments</li>
                       </ol>
                       
                       <h5>How to run your first research</h5>

                       <li><b>Define the research objective:</b> why are we running the research? what are the questions that you want answered?</li>
                       <li><b>Consider the profile of people you want to understand.</b> In the research industry this is also called defining your audience, or target audience. A target audience is defined based on demographic and behavioural questions. For example, if you want to test the efficiency of a product package for a grocery type product, you want to target the people who are doing grocery shopping, being online or offline.</li>

                       </ol>
